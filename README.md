## My Work
__Manual Testing__
 * [Here is an example of a Test Plan / Test log i created for educational purposes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NOWuZfHz2At_I7FeXZSv4b5HHJd4XyMb/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=101894223347022747102&rtpof=true&sd=true)
 * In the example above I am testing a mobile network providing service which includes calculations of prices based on different providers and additional discount they may provide. In this application I encountered a few bugs in the calculation of actual prices when I cross-referenced them against my expected results. These bugs were then recorded in a test report and screenshots were provided.

__Automation Testing__
